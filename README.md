# Code and data for "Temporally variable stream width distributions in a headwater catchment"

This repository contains code and data to replicate results from Barefoot et al. (in prep)

## Install

You will have to have a working `R` installation to use these routines. To get `R` -- which is free -- download and install from [the R website](https://www.r-project.org/)

To install, download this repository and put it somewhere in your computer. Then open a terminal with this folder as the working directory and type:
```bash
./stony_creek_analysis.r
```

This command will replicate all the analysis presented in the paper, and open draft versions of the main figures.
