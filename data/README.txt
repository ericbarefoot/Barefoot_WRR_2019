README for headwater streams project data files

Dec 2017

Enclosed is a large amount of hand-collected field data from several headwater catchments worldwide. It is a valuable resource, so do not mess with the original data unless you know what you are doing. 

Also contained are hydrological data from each catchment or nearby catchments, as well as mapping data, GIS data, and associated data products. This README will serve as a guide to the data, its structure, and originally intended uses. 

-------------------------
Field Data
-------------------------

Hand-measured collections of stream width are included for the following headwater catchments: 

1 Kings Creek, Kansas, USA
2 Sagehen Creek, California, USA
3 Elder Creek, California, USA
4 Caribou Creek, Alaska, USA
5 V40 Stream, Westland, New Zealand
6 Blue Duck Creek, Kaikoura, New Zealand
7 Stony Creek*, North Carolina, USA

* A sub-basin of Stony Creek was surveyed several times, and these repeat surveys have a different structure. 



-------------------------
Hydrological Data
-------------------------

All data is supplied as a time-stamped series of discharge, and also converted to mm/day for comparison between catchments.
Each hydrological dataset is associated with each of the field measurement datasets, and the files are associated as follows:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7

-------------------------
GIS and Mapping Data
-------------------------

Centerlines of each stream were hand mapped either in the field or via aerial imagery [also include imagery data source] for visualization and GIS analysis. 
These datasets are associated with the field measurement datasets as follows:

-------------------------
Associated Data Products
-------------------------

In addition to presenting and including field data, relevant hydrological data, and GIS mapping data, we include a set of associated data products and summaries. 
They are described below.
